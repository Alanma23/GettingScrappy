# GettingScrappy
Getting Scrappy! is a game that teaches players how to sort discarded items into trash, recycling, and compost bins (and more). Players are gradually introduced to the rules of recycling, and even delve into more complex rules like putting bottle caps in the trash, but bottles into a different bin. In the game, discarded items roll across a conveyor belt. Players must drag these items into the correct bins below the conveyor belt to gain points. After playing, the game saves user progress and high scores. Getting Scrappy! was made using Unity 2018.4.7 with C#.
